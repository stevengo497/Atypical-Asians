# Atypical-Asians

Atypical Asians is a card matching game. This is my first project ever and it incorporates the basics of web development. My main goal was to make sure the functionality works, then I would start styling the web page. 

## User Experience
- Users play a classic card matching game, but using Asian celebrites for added difficulty.
- Players can only flip 2 cards at a time
- If cards match, then cards will disappear
- If cards do not match, player cannot click on another card until the previous 2 cards are flipped back around
- Set timer w/ alert for winner and loser

## Bonus goals
- make pictures randomize for continual play
- REFACTOR
- possibly place cards on a 'table'

## Technology used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript/jQuery
